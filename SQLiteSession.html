Provides a single client the ability to use a database.

<h2>About database sessions</h2>
<p>
  Database access is always performed using a session.  The session
  manages the lifecycle of transactions and database connections.
</p><p>
  Sessions can be used to perform both read-only and read-write operations.
  There is some advantage to knowing when a session is being used for
  read-only purposes because the connection pool can optimize the use
  of the available connections to permit multiple read-only operations
  to execute in parallel whereas read-write operations may need to be serialized.
</p><p>
  When <em>Write Ahead Logging (WAL)</em> is enabled, the database can
  execute simultaneous read-only and read-write transactions, provided that
  at most one read-write transaction is performed at a time.  When WAL is not
  enabled, read-only transactions can execute in parallel but read-write
  transactions are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<h2>Ownership and concurrency guarantees</h2>
<p>
  Session objects are not thread-safe.  In fact, session objects are thread-bound.
  The {@link SQLiteDatabase} uses a thread-local variable to associate a session
  with each thread for the use of that thread alone.  Consequently, each thread
  has its own session object and therefore its own transaction state independent
  of other threads.
</p><p>
  A thread has at most one session per database.  This constraint ensures that
  a thread can never use more than one database connection at a time for a
  given database.  As the number of available database connections is limited,
  if a single thread tried to acquire multiple connections for the same database
  at the same time, it might deadlock.  Therefore we allow there to be only
  one session (so, at most one connection) per thread per database.
</p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>
<p>
  There are two kinds of transaction: implicit transactions and explicit
  transactions.
</p><p>
  An implicit transaction is created whenever a database operation is requested
  and there is no explicit transaction currently in progress.  An implicit transaction
  only lasts for the duration of the database operation in question and then it
  is ended.  If the database operation was successful, then its changes are committed.
</p><p>
  An explicit transaction is started by calling {@link #beginTransaction} and
  specifying the desired transaction mode.  Once an explicit transaction has begun,
  all subsequent database operations will be performed as part of that transaction.
  To end an explicit transaction, first call {@link #setTransactionSuccessful} if the
  transaction was successful, then call {@link #end}.  If the transaction was
  marked successful, its changes will be committed, otherwise they will be rolled back.
</p><p>
  Explicit transactions can also be nested.  A nested explicit transaction is
  started with {@link #beginTransaction}, marked successful with
  {@link #setTransactionSuccessful}and ended with {@link #endTransaction}.
  If any nested transaction is not marked successful, then the entire transaction
  including all of its nested transactions will be rolled back
  when the outermost transaction is ended.
</p><p>
  To improve concurrency, an explicit transaction can be yielded by calling
  {@link #yieldTransaction}.  If there is contention for use of the database,
  then yielding ends the current transaction, commits its changes, releases the
  database connection for use by another session for a little while, and starts a
  new transaction with the same properties as the original one.
  Changes committed by {@link #yieldTransaction} cannot be rolled back.
</p><p>
  When a transaction is started, the client can provide a {@link SQLiteTransactionListener}
  to listen for notifications of transaction-related events.
</p><p>
  Recommended usage:
  <code><pre>
  // First, begin the transaction.
  session.beginTransaction(SQLiteSession.TRANSACTION_MODE_DEFERRED, 0);
  try {
      // Then do stuff...
      session.execute("INSERT INTO ...", null, 0);

      // As the very last step before ending the transaction, mark it successful.
      session.setTransactionSuccessful();
  } finally {
      // Finally, end the transaction.
      // This statement will commit the transaction if it was marked successful or
      // roll it back otherwise.
      session.endTransaction();
  }
  </pre></code>
</p>

<h2>Database connections</h2>
<p>
  A {@link SQLiteDatabase} can have multiple active sessions at the same
  time.  Each session acquires and releases connections to the database
  as needed to perform each requested database transaction.  If all connections
  are in use, then database transactions on some sessions will block until a
  connection becomes available.
</p><p>
  The session acquires a single database connection only for the duration
  of a single (implicit or explicit) database transaction, then releases it.
  This characteristic allows a small pool of database connections to be shared
  efficiently by multiple sessions as long as they are not all trying to perform
  database transactions at the same time.
</p>

<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
<p>
  Because there are a limited number of database connections and the session holds
  a database connection for the entire duration of a database transaction,
  it is important to keep transactions short.  This is especially important
  for read-write transactions since they may block other transactions
  from executing.  Consider calling {@link #yieldTransaction} periodically
  during long-running transactions.
</p><p>
  Another important consideration is that transactions that take too long to
  run may cause the application UI to become unresponsive.  Even if the transaction
  is executed in a background thread, the user will get bored and
  frustrated if the application shows no data for several seconds while
  a transaction runs.
</p><p>
  Guidelines:
<ul>
  <li>Do not perform database transactions on the UI thread.</li>
  <li>Keep database transactions as short as possible.</li>
  <li>Simple queries often run faster than complex queries.</li>
  <li>Measure the performance of your database transactions.</li>
  <li>Consider what will happen when the size of the data set grows.
    A query that works well on 100 rows may struggle with 10,000.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reentrance</h2>
<p>
  This class must tolerate reentrant execution of SQLite operations because
  triggers may call custom SQLite functions that perform additional queries.
